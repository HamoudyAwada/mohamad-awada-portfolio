            <h1>Thanks for Visting!</h1>
            <p>My name is Mohamad, but I often go by Moe! Welcome to my online portfolio. I'm a junior UX/UI designer currently studying at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, or SAIT for short. To me, to exist is to be creative, and so I try my best to live that to it's fullest and truest extent! I live and breathe different kinds of media, and so lately I'm doing my best to create as much media as I consume! I view every day as a new opportunity to learn and further polish my skills, and always take on tasks with an open mind. Thanks for taking the time to have a look at where I am on my journey right now, and I hope you'll take some time to explore and see who I am as well as who I'm on track to become!
