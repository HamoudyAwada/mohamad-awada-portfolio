                Hey! My name is Mohamad Awada, but most people in my life call me Moe! I'm a 20 year old UX/UI designer who enjoys all things interactive design. Aside from that though, I am a content creator, mainly through YouTube, I'm an artist, mostly via glass painting, but most of all, I'm a real person! I love what I do, but it's really important to me that I'm able to define myself without my work. I live and breathe creative expression, and I always try to take that mindset with me into whatever it may be that Im pursuing. Lately I've been specifically focusing on my video creation! I have always loved media with a purpose. Creativity in any medium is amazing, but when it's blended with real meaning and something to take away from it, however serious or unserious it may be, I beliueve that it adds a whole new dimension to it. I'm learning and growing every day, and am always open to opportunities to keep me on that track of growth and newness. Below, you can find some of the different things that make me, me! One of the things that I have come to love about myself as I grow as a person is my extroverted nature! If you'd like to connect or even just chat, please reach out! I'd love to have a chat!
